Introduction
This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration through the use
of Docker technology. You will virtualize several Docker images by creating them in your
new personal virtual machine.

Chapter III
General guidelines
• This project must be completed on a Virtual Machine.
• All the files required for the configuration of your project must be placed in a srcs
folder.
• A Makefile is also required and must be located at the root of your directory. It
must set up your entire application (i.e., it has to build the Docker images using
docker-compose.yml).
• This subject requires putting into practice concepts that, depending on your background, you may not have learned yet. Therefore, we advise you to read extensive
documentation related to Docker usage, as well as any other resources you find
helpful to complete this assignment.

AI Instructions
● Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to
explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. However, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it’s
code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure
that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers
are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.

● Main message
☛ Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
☛ Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit your
future career.
☛ Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,
and ethical issues.
☛ Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛ Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility
for.

● Learner rules:
• You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so
you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
• You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write clearer,
more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
• You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning,
and testing anything generated by AI.
• You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.

● Phase outcomes:
• Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
• Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
• Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and
collaboration.

● Comments and examples:
• You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where
you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your
technical and interpersonal skills.
• Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your understanding. Make peer learning a priority.
• AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your
peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
• Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alternative perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.
✓ Good practice:
I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. I try them out
and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
✗ Bad practice:
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peerevaluation, I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail my
project.
✓ Good practice:
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch
two bugs and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
✗ Bad practice:
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t
explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my
project.

Chapter V
Mandatory part
This project involves setting up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You must use
Docker Compose.
Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
Each service has to run in a dedicated container.
For performance reasons, the containers must be built from either the penultimate stable
version of Alpine or Debian. The choice is yours.
You also have to write your own Dockerfiles, one per service. The Dockerfiles must
be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile.
This means you must build the Docker images for your project yourself. It is then forbidden to pull ready-made Docker images or use services such as DockerHub (Alpine/Debian
being excluded from this rule).
You then have to set up:
• A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
• A Docker container that contains WordPress with php-fpm (it must be installed
and configured) only, without nginx.
• A Docker container that contains only MariaDB, without nginx.
• A volume that contains your WordPress database.
• A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
• A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
Your containers must restart automatically in case of a crash.
A Docker container is not a virtual machine. Thus, it is not
recommended to use any hacky patches based on ’tail -f’ and similar
methods when trying to run it. Read about how daemons work and
whether it’s a good idea to use them or not.

Inception

Of course, using network: host or --link or links: is forbidden.
The network line must be present in your docker-compose.yml file.
Your containers must not be started with a command running an
infinite loop. Thus, this also applies to any command used as
entrypoint, or used in entrypoint scripts. The following are a
few prohibited hacky patches: tail -f, bash, sleep infinity, while
true.

Read about PID 1 and the best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

• In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the administrator. The administrator’s username must not contain ’admin’, ’Admin’, ’administrator’, or ’Administrator’ (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123,
etc.).

Your volumes will be available in the /home/login/data folder of the
host machine using Docker. Of course, you have to replace the login
with yours.

To simplify the process, you must configure your domain name to point to your local
IP address.
This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you must use your own login.
For example, if your login is ’wil’, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to
Wil’s website.
The latest tag is prohibited.
Passwords must not be present in your Dockerfiles.
The use of environment variables is mandatory.
It is also strongly recommended to use a .env file to store
environment variables and to use the Docker secrets to store any
confidential information.
Your NGINX container must be the sole entry point into your
infrastructure, accessible only via port 443, using the TLSv1.2
or TLSv1.3 protocol.

For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, passwords,
etc., must be saved locally in various ways / files and ignored by
git. Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.

You can store your variables (as a domain name) in an environment
variable file like .env

Chapter VI
Bonus part
For this project, the bonus part is intended to be simple.
A Dockerfile must be written for each additional service. Thus, each service will run
inside its own container and will have, if necessary, its dedicated volume.
Bonus list:
• Set up redis cache for your WordPress website in order to properly manage the
cache.
• Set up a FTP server container pointing to the volume of your WordPress website.
• Create a simple static website in the language of your choice except PHP (yes, PHP
is excluded). For example, a showcase site or a site for presenting your resume.
• Set up Adminer.
• Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful. During the defense, you
will have to justify your choice.

To complete the bonus part, you have the possibility to set up extra
services. In this case, you may open more ports to suit your needs.

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
completed perfectly. Perfect means the mandatory part has been
fully completed and functions without any malfunctions. If you have
not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not
be evaluated at all.

Chapter VII
Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment to your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Do not hesitate to double-check the
names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or
rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
While this step may not be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it
if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.
This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g.,
your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes — unless a specific
timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation.
You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.
The details (scope, target, etc.) will be specified in the evaluation guidelines and may
vary from one evaluation to another for the same project.
